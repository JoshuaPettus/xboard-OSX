<P><I>WinBoard</I> is a graphical user interface for chess. It displays a chessboard on the screen, accepts moves made with the mouse, and loads and saves game files in standard chess notation. WinBoard serves as a front-end for many different services, including:

<UL>
	<LI><B><I>Chess engines</I></B> that run on your PC. You can play a game against an engine, set up arbitrary positions, force variations, or watch a game between two engines. <I><font color="#008000">Fairy-Max</font></I> is supplied with WinBoard <font color="#008000">4.3.14,</font> and over 100 other free chess engines are available separately. Of these, Crafty is the most popular. See <A HREF="20.htm">Installing Chess Engines</A> for instructions on installing additional chess engines.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B><I>Chess servers</I> </B>on the Internet. You can play against other Internet Chess Server (ICS) users, observe games they are playing, review games in the ICS libraries, chat, <font color="#3333ff">analyze observed games with a chess program</font>, and more. WinBoard can also be used to run an automated computer player on the ICS, but this feature is for advanced users only and is subject to some caveats; see the separate file zippy.README for information.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B><I>The Web</I></B> and your own saved games. You can use WinBoard as a helper application to view files in your Web browser or the Explorer. You can use it to keep track of email postal games, browse games off the net, or review games you have saved.</LI>
</UL>



<P><B><A NAME="gettingstarted"></A>Getting Started</B></P>

<P>WinBoard starts up in one of three major modes: chess engine mode, ICS client mode, or game viewer mode. You cannot change modes while WinBoard is running, but you can access all the game viewer features directly from the other two modes. Also, you can start WinBoard several times to get multiple chessboard windows running in any combination of modes.</P>

<P>You will usually run WinBoard by choosing an item from the Windows Start menu that runs it in the mode you want. If you just double-click on WinBoard.exe, you get a startup dialog asking which mode you want. If you choose chess engine mode, you can then select from the installed engines; if you choose ICS client mode, you can then select from a list of known chess servers. More advanced users can <A HREF="16.htm#icsnames">customize</A> these lists or type in WinBoard <A HREF="11.htm">command line options</A> directly.</P>



<P>After starting WinBoard, you can make <A NAME="move"></A>moves in several different ways. To move by dragging, press the left mouse button while the cursor is on one of your pieces, move the cursor to another square, and release the button. You can also move by clicking the left mouse button once (press and release) over one of your pieces, moving the cursor to another square, and clicking again. You drop new pieces on the board (when applicable) by selecting from a context menu. Press the right mouse button over a square to bring up the menu; no menu will come up in modes where dropping a new piece is not permitted. You can also make moves by typing them in standard algebraic chess notation. Either a dialog box will pop up for you to type into, or in ICS mode, your typing will be redirected into the ICS interaction window.</P>



<P>When WinBoard<I> </I>is iconized, its <A NAME="icon"></A>icon is a white knight if it is White's turn to move, a black knight if it is Black's turn.</P>
