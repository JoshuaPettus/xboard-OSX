     <dl>
<dt>Backward<dd><a name="index-Backward_002c-Menu-Item-60"></a><a name="index-g_t_003c_002c-Button-61"></a>Steps backward through a series of remembered moves. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[&lt;]</span></samp>&rsquo; button and the <kbd>b</kbd> key are equivalents,
as is turning the mouse wheel towards you. 
In addition, pressing the Control key steps back one move, and releasing
it steps forward again.

     <p>In most modes, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo; only lets you look back at old positions;
it does not retract moves. This is the case if you are playing against
a chess engine, playing or observing a game on an ICS, or loading a game. 
If you select &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo; in any of these situations, you will not
be allowed to make a different move. Use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Retract Move</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edit Game</span></samp>&rsquo; if you want to change past moves.

     <p>If you are examining an ICS game, the behavior of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo;
depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is
off, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo; issues the ICS backward command, which backs up
everyone's view of the game and allows you to make a different
move. If Pause mode is on, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo; only backs up your local
view. 
<br><dt>Forward<dd><a name="index-Forward_002c-Menu-Item-62"></a><a name="index-g_t_003e_002c-Button-63"></a>Steps forward through a series of remembered moves (undoing the
effect of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo;) or forward through a game file. The
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[&gt;]</span></samp>&rsquo; button and the <kbd>f</kbd> key are equivalents,
as is turning the mouse wheel away from you.

     <p>If you are examining an ICS game, the behavior of Forward
depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is
off, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward</span></samp>&rsquo; issues the ICS forward command, which moves
everyone's view of the game forward along the current line. If
Pause mode is on, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward</span></samp>&rsquo; only moves your local view forward,
and it will not go past the position that the game was in when
you paused. 
<br><dt>Back to Start<dd><a name="index-Back-to-Start_002c-Menu-Item-64"></a><a name="index-g_t_003c_003c_002c-Button-65"></a>Jumps backward to the first remembered position in the game. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[&lt;&lt;]</span></samp>&rsquo; button and the shifted <kbd>B</kbd> key are equivalents.

     <p>In most modes, Back to Start only lets you look back at old
positions; it does not retract moves. This is the case if you
are playing against a local chess engine, playing or observing a game on
a chess server, or loading a game. If you select &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Back to Start</span></samp>&rsquo; in any
of these situations, you will not be allowed to make different
moves. Use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Retract Move</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edit Game</span></samp>&rsquo; if you want to change past
moves; or use Reset to start a new game.

     <p>If you are examining an ICS game, the behavior of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Back to
Start</span></samp>&rsquo; depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode
is off, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Back to Start</span></samp>&rsquo; issues the ICS &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">backward 999999</span></samp>&rsquo;
command, which backs up everyone's view of the game to the start and
allows you to make different moves. If Pause mode is on, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Back
to Start</span></samp>&rsquo; only backs up your local view. 
<br><dt>Forward to End<dd><a name="index-Forward-to-End_002c-Menu-Item-66"></a><a name="index-g_t_003e_003e_002c-Button-67"></a>Jumps forward to the last remembered position in the game. The
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[&gt;&gt;]</span></samp>&rsquo; button and the shifted <kbd>F</kbd> key are equivalents.

     <p>If you are examining an ICS game, the behavior of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward to
End</span></samp>&rsquo; depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode
is off, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward to End</span></samp>&rsquo; issues the ICS &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">forward 999999</span></samp>&rsquo;
command, which moves everyone's view of the game forward to the end of
the current line. If Pause mode is on, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward to End</span></samp>&rsquo; only moves
your local view forward, and it will not go past the position
that the game was in when you paused. 
<br><dt>Revert<dd><a name="index-Revert_002c-Menu-Item-68"></a>If you are examining an ICS game and Pause mode is off, issues
the ICS command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">revert</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<br><dt>Truncate Game<dd><a name="index-Truncate-Game_002c-Menu-Item-69"></a>Discards all remembered moves of the game beyond the current
position. Puts XBoard into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edit Game</span></samp>&rsquo; mode if it was not there
already. 
<br><dt>Move Now<dd><a name="index-Move-Now_002c-Menu-Item-70"></a>Forces the chess engine to move immediately. Chess engine mode only. 
<br><dt>Retract Move<dd><a name="index-Retract-Move_002c-Menu-Item-71"></a>Retracts your last move. In chess engine mode, you can do this only
after the chess engine has replied to your move; if the chess engine is still
thinking, use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Move Now</span></samp>&rsquo; first. In ICS mode, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Retract Move</span></samp>&rsquo;
issues the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">takeback 1</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">takeback 2</span></samp>&rsquo;
depending on whether it is your opponent's move or yours.
