<p><a name="index-Menu_002c-Mode-49"></a><a name="index-Mode-Menu-50"></a>
     <dl>
<dt>Machine White<dd><a name="index-Machine-White_002c-Menu-Item-51"></a>Tells the chess engine to play White. 
The <kbd>Ctrl-W</kbd> key is a keyboard equivalent. 
<br><dt>Machine Black<dd><a name="index-Machine-Black_002c-Menu-Item-52"></a>Tells the chess engine to play Black. 
The <kbd>Ctrl-B</kbd> key is a keyboard equivalent. 
<br><dt>Two Machines<dd><a name="index-Two-Machines_002c-Menu-Item-53"></a>Plays a game between two chess engines. 
The <kbd>Ctrl-T</kbd> key is a keyboard equivalent. 
<br><dt>Analysis Mode<dd><a name="index-Analysis-Mode_002c-Menu-Item-54"></a>XBoard tells the chess engine to start analyzing the current game/position
and shows you the analysis as you move pieces around. 
The <kbd>Ctrl-A</kbd> key is a keyboard equivalent. 
Note: Some chess engines do not support Analysis mode.

     <p>To set up a position to analyze, you do the following:

     <p>1. Select Edit Position from the Mode Menu

     <p>2. Set up the position.  Use the middle and right buttons to
bring up the white and black piece menus.

     <p>3. When you are finished, click on either the Black or White
clock to tell XBoard which side moves first.

     <p>4. Select Analysis Mode from the Mode Menu to start the analysis.

     <p>The analysis function can also be used when observing games on an ICS
with an engine loaded (zippy mode); the engine then will analyse
the positions as they occur in the observed game. 
<br><dt>Analyze File<dd><a name="index-Analyze-File_002c-Menu-Item-55"></a>This option lets you load a game from a file (PGN, XBoard format, etc.) 
and analyze it. The <kbd>Ctrl-F</kbd> key is a keyboard equivalent. 
When you select this menu item, a pop-up window appears
and asks for a file name to load. 
If the file contains multiple games, another pop up appears that lets
you select which game you wish to analyze. 
After a game is loaded, XBoard will start auto-playing the game,
while the engine is analyzing the current position. 
The game will be annotated with the results of these analyses. 
In particlar, the score and depth will be added as a comment,
and the PV will be added as a variation. 
The time the engine spends on analyzing each move can be controlled
through the command-line option &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-timeDelay</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Note: Some chess engines do not support Analysis mode. 
<br><dt>Edit Game<dd>Duplicate of the item in the Edit menu. 
Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edit Game</span></samp>&rsquo; is the idle mode of XBoard, and can be used
to get you out of other modes. E.g. to stop analyzing, stop a game
between two engines or stop editing a position. 
<br><dt>Edit Position<dd>Duplicate of the item in the Edit menu. 
<br><dt>Training<dd><a name="index-Training_002c-Menu-Item-56"></a>Training mode lets you interactively guess the moves of a game for one
of the players. You guess the next move of the game by playing the
move on the board. If the move played matches the next move of the
game, the move is accepted and the opponent's response is auto-played. 
If the move played is incorrect, an error message is displayed.  You
can select this mode only while loading a game (that is, after
selecting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Load Game</span></samp>&rsquo; from the File menu).  While XBoard is in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Training</span></samp>&rsquo; mode, the navigation buttons are disabled. 
<br><dt>ICS Client<dd><a name="index-ICS-Client_002c-Menu-Item-57"></a>This is the normal mode when XBoard
is connected to a chess server.  If you have moved into
Edit Game or Edit Position mode, you can select this option to get out.

     <p>To use xboard in ICS mode, run it in the foreground with the -ics
option, and use the terminal you started it from to type commands and
receive text responses from the chess server.  See
<a href="Chess-Servers.html#Chess-Servers">Chess Servers</a> below for more information.

     <p>XBoard activates some special position/game editing features when you
use the <kbd>examine</kbd> or <kbd>bsetup</kbd> commands on ICS and you have
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ICS Client</span></samp>&rsquo; selected on the Mode menu.  First, you can issue the
ICS position-editing commands with the mouse.  Move pieces by dragging
with mouse button 1.  To drop a new piece on a square, press mouse
button 2 or 3 over the square.  This brings up a menu of white pieces
(button 2) or black pieces (button 3).  Additional menu choices let
you empty the square or clear the board.  Click on the White or Black
clock to set the side to play.  You cannot set the side to play or
drag pieces to arbitrary squares while examining on ICC, but you can
do so in <kbd>bsetup</kbd> mode on FICS.  In addition, the menu commands
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Pause</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Stop Examining</span></samp>&rsquo;
have special functions in this mode; see below. 
<br><dt>Pause<dd><a name="index-Pause_002c-Menu-Item-58"></a>Pauses updates to the board, and if you are playing against a chess engine,
also pauses your clock. To continue, select &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Pause</span></samp>&rsquo; again, and the
display will automatically update to the latest position. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">P</span></samp>&rsquo; button and keyboard <kbd>Pause</kbd> key are equivalents.

     <p>If you select Pause when you are playing against a chess engine and
it is not your move, the chess engine's clock
will continue to run and it will eventually make a move, at which point
both clocks will stop. Since board updates are paused, however,
you will not see the move until you exit from Pause mode (or select Forward). 
This behavior is meant to simulate adjournment with a sealed move.

     <p>If you select Pause while you are observing or examining a game on a
chess server, you can step backward and forward in the current history
of the examined game without affecting the other observers and
examiners, and without having your display jump forward to the latest
position each time a move is made. Select Pause again to reconnect
yourself to the current state of the game on ICS.

     <p>If you select &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Pause</span></samp>&rsquo; while you are loading a game, the game stops
loading. You can load more moves manually by selecting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward</span></samp>&rsquo;, or
resume automatic loading by selecting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Pause</span></samp>&rsquo; again.
