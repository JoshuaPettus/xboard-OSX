<p><a name="index-Menu_002c-Mode-26"></a><a name="index-Mode-Menu-27"></a>
     <dl>
<dt>Machine White<dd><a name="index-Machine-White_002c-Menu-Item-28"></a>Tells the chess engine to play White. 
<br><dt>Machine Black<dd><a name="index-Machine-Black_002c-Menu-Item-29"></a>Tells the chess engine to play Black. 
<br><dt>Two Machines<dd><a name="index-Two-Machines_002c-Menu-Item-30"></a>Plays a game between two chess engines. 
<br><dt>Analysis Mode<dd><a name="index-Analysis-Mode_002c-Menu-Item-31"></a>XBoard tells the chess engine to start analyzing the current game/position
and shows you the analysis as you move pieces around. 
Note: Some chess engines do not support Analysis mode.

     <p>To set up a position to analyze, you do the following:

     <p>1. Select Edit Position from the Mode Menu

     <p>2. Set up the position.  Use the middle and right buttons to
bring up the white and black piece menus.

     <p>3. When you are finished, click on either the Black or White
clock to tell XBoard which side moves first.

     <p>4. Select Analysis Mode from the Mode Menu to start the analysis.

     <p>The analysis function can also be used when observing games on an ICS
with an engine loaded (zippy mode); the engine then will analyse
the positions as they occur in the observed game. 
<br><dt>Analyze File<dd><a name="index-Analyze-File_002c-Menu-Item-32"></a>This option lets you load a game from a file (PGN, XBoard format, etc.) 
and analyze it. When you select this menu item, a popup window appears
and asks for a filename to load. 
If the file contains multiple games, another popup appears that lets
you select which game you wish to analyze. 
After a game is loaded, use the XBoard arrow buttons to step
forwards/backwards through the game and watch the analysis. 
Note: Some chess engines do not support Analysis mode. 
<br><dt>ICS Client<dd><a name="index-ICS-Client_002c-Menu-Item-33"></a>This is the normal mode when XBoard
is connected to a chess server.  If you have moved into
Edit Game or Edit Position mode, you can select this option to get out.

     <p>To use xboard in ICS mode, run it in the foreground with the -ics
option, and use the terminal you started it from to type commands and
receive text responses from the chess server.  See
<a href="Chess-Servers.html#Chess-Servers">Chess Servers</a> below for more information.

     <p>XBoard activates some special position/game editing features when you
use the <kbd>examine</kbd> or <kbd>bsetup</kbd> commands on ICS and you have
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ICS Client</span></samp>&rsquo; selected on the Mode menu.  First, you can issue the
ICS position-editing commands with the mouse.  Move pieces by dragging
with mouse button 1.  To drop a new piece on a square, press mouse
button 2 or 3 over the square.  This brings up a menu of white pieces
(button 2) or black pieces (button 3).  Additional menu choices let
you empty the square or clear the board.  Click on the White or Black
clock to set the side to play.  You cannot set the side to play or
drag pieces to arbitrary squares while examining on ICC, but you can
do so in <kbd>bsetup</kbd> mode on FICS.  In addition, the menu commands
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Pause</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Stop Examining</span></samp>&rsquo;
have special functions in this mode; see below. 
<br><dt>Edit Game<dd><a name="index-Edit-Game_002c-Menu-Item-34"></a>Allows you to make moves for both Black and White, and to change
moves after backing up with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo; command. The clocks do
not run.

     <p>In chess engine mode, the chess engine continues to check moves for legality
but does not participate in the game. You can bring the chess engine
into the game by selecting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Machine White</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Machine Black</span></samp>&rsquo;,
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Two Machines</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>In ICS mode, the moves are not sent to the ICS: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edit Game</span></samp>&rsquo; takes
XBoard out of ICS Client mode and lets you edit games locally. 
If you want to edit games on ICS in a way that other ICS users
can see, use the ICS <kbd>examine</kbd> command or start an ICS match
against yourself. 
<br><dt>Edit Position<dd><a name="index-Edit-Position_002c-Menu-Item-35"></a>Lets you set up an arbitrary board position. 
Use mouse button 1 to drag pieces to new squares, or to delete a piece
by dragging it off the board or dragging an empty square on top of it. 
To drop a new piece on a square, press mouse button 2 or 3 over the
square. This brings up a menu of white pieces (button 2) or
black pieces (button 3). Additional menu choices let you empty the
square or clear the board. You can set the side to play next by
clicking on the word White or Black at the top of the screen. 
Selecting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edit Position</span></samp>&rsquo; causes XBoard to discard
all remembered moves in the current game.

     <p>In ICS mode, changes made to the position by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edit Position</span></samp>&rsquo; are
not sent to the ICS: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edit Position</span></samp>&rsquo; takes XBoard out of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ICS Client</span></samp>&rsquo; mode and lets you edit positions locally. If you want to
edit positions on ICS in a way that other ICS users can see, use
the ICS <kbd>examine</kbd> command, or start an ICS match against yourself. 
(See also the ICS Client topic above.) 
<br><dt>Training<dd><a name="index-Training_002c-Menu-Item-36"></a>Training mode lets you interactively guess the moves of a game for one
of the players. You guess the next move of the game by playing the
move on the board. If the move played matches the next move of the
game, the move is accepted and the opponent's response is autoplayed. 
If the move played is incorrect, an error message is displayed.  You
can select this mode only while loading a game (that is, after
selecting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Load Game</span></samp>&rsquo; from the File menu).  While XBoard is in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Training</span></samp>&rsquo; mode, the navigation buttons are disabled. 
<br><dt>Show Game List<dd><a name="index-Show-Game-List_002c-Menu-Item-37"></a>Shows or hides the list of games generated by the last &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Load Game</span></samp>&rsquo;
command. 
<br><dt>Show Move History<dd><a name="index-Show-Move-History_002c-Menu-Item-38"></a>Shows or hides a list of moves of the current game. 
This list allows you to move the display to any earlier position in the game
by clicking on the corresponding move. 
<br><dt>Show Engine Output<dd><a name="index-Show-Engine-Output_002c-Menu-Item-39"></a>Shows or hides a window in which the thinking output of any loaded engines
is displayed. 
<br><dt>Edit Tags<dd><a name="index-Edit-Tags_002c-Menu-Item-40"></a>Lets you edit the PGN (portable game notation)
tags for the current game. After editing, the tags must still conform to
the PGN tag syntax:

     <pre class="example">          &lt;tag-section&gt; ::= &lt;tag-pair&gt; &lt;tag-section&gt;
                                  &lt;empty&gt;
          &lt;tag-pair&gt; ::= [ &lt;tag-name&gt; &lt;tag-value&gt; ]
          &lt;tag-name&gt; ::= &lt;identifier&gt;
          &lt;tag-value&gt; ::= &lt;string&gt;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">See the PGN Standard for full details. Here is an example:

     <pre class="example">          [Event "Portoroz Interzonal"]
          [Site "Portoroz, Yugoslavia"]
          [Date "1958.08.16"]
          [Round "8"]
          [White "Robert J. Fischer"]
          [Black "Bent Larsen"]
          [Result "1-0"]
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Any characters that do not match this syntax are silently ignored. Note that
the PGN standard requires all games to have at least the seven tags shown
above. Any that you omit will be filled in by XBoard
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; (unknown value), or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; (inapplicable value). 
<br><dt>Edit Comment<dd><a name="index-Edit-Comment_002c-Menu-Item-41"></a>Adds or modifies a comment on the current position. Comments are
saved by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Save Game</span></samp>&rsquo; and are displayed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Load Game</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<br><dt>ICS Input Box<dd><a name="index-ICS-Input-Box_002c-Menu-Item-42"></a>If this option is set in ICS mode,
XBoard
creates an extra window that you can use for typing in ICS commands. 
The input box is especially useful if you want to type in something long or do
some editing on your input, because output from ICS doesn't get mixed
in with your typing as it would in the main terminal window. 
<br><dt>Pause<dd><a name="index-Pause_002c-Menu-Item-43"></a>Pauses updates to the board, and if you are playing against a chess engine,
also pauses your clock. To continue, select &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Pause</span></samp>&rsquo; again, and the
display will automatically update to the latest position. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">P</span></samp>&rsquo; button and keyboard <kbd>p</kbd> key are equivalents.

     <p>If you select Pause when you are playing against a chess engine and
it is not your move, the chess engine's clock
will continue to run and it will eventually make a move, at which point
both clocks will stop. Since board updates are paused, however,
you will not see the move until you exit from Pause mode (or select Forward). 
This behavior is meant to simulate adjournment with a sealed move.

     <p>If you select Pause while you are observing or examining a game on a
chess server, you can step backward and forward in the current history
of the examined game without affecting the other observers and
examiners, and without having your display jump forward to the latest
position each time a move is made. Select Pause again to reconnect
yourself to the current state of the game on ICS.

     <p>If you select &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Pause</span></samp>&rsquo; while you are loading a game, the game stops
loading. You can load more moves manually by selecting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward</span></samp>&rsquo;, or
resume automatic loading by selecting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Pause</span></samp>&rsquo; again.
