<h2 class="chapter">10 Authors and contributors</h2>

Chris Sears and Dan Sears wrote the original XBoard.  They were
responsible for versions 1.0 through 1.2.  The color scheme was taken
from Wayne Christopher's <code>XChess</code> program.

   <p>Tim Mann was primarily responsible for XBoard versions 1.3 through
4.2.7, and for WinBoard (a port of XBoard to Microsoft Win32) from its
inception through version 4.2.7.

   <p>John Chanak contributed the initial implementation of ICS mode.  Evan
Welsh wrote <code>CMail</code>, and Patrick Surry helped in designing,
testing, and documenting it.  Elmar Bartel contributed the new piece
bitmaps introduced in version 3.2.  Jochen Wiedmann converted the
documentation to texinfo.  Frank McIngvale added click/click moving,
the Analysis modes, piece flashing, ZIICS import, and ICS text
colorization to XBoard.  Hugh Fisher added animated piece movement to
XBoard, and Henrik Gram added it to WinBoard.  Mark Williams
contributed the initial (WinBoard-only) implementation of many new
features added to both XBoard and WinBoard in version 4.1.0, including
copy/paste, premove, icsAlarm, autoFlipView, training mode, auto
raise, and blindfold.  Ben Nye contributed X copy/paste code for
XBoard.

   <p>In a fork from version 4.2.7, Alessandro Scotti added many elements to
the user interface of WinBoard, including the board textures and
font-based rendering, the evaluation-graph, move-history and
engine-output window.  He was also responsible for adding the UCI
support.

   <p>H. G. Muller continued this fork of the project, producing version
4.3.  He made WinBoard castling- and e.p.-aware, added variant support
with adjustable board sizes, the crazyhouse holdings, and the fairy
pieces.  In addition he added most of the adjudication options, made
WinBoard more robust in dealing with buggy and crashing engines, and
extended time control with a time-odds and node-count-based modes. 
Most of the options that initially were WinBoard only have now been
back-ported to XBoard.

   <p>Michel van den Bergh provided the code for reading Polyglot opening books.

   <p>Meanwhile, some work continued on the GNU XBoard project maintained at
savannah.gnu.org, but version 4.2.8 was never released.  Daniel
Mehrmann was responsible for much of this work.

   <p>Most recently, Arun Persaud worked with H. G. Muller to merge all
the features of the never-released XBoard/WinBoard 4.2.8 of the GNU
XBoard project and the never-released 4.3.16 from H. G.'s fork into a
unified XBoard/WinBoard 4.4, which is now available both from the
savannah.gnu.org web site and the WinBoard forum.
