<p><a name="index-Options_002c-miscellaneous-520"></a>
     <dl>
<dt>-ncp/-xncp or -noChessProgram true/false<dd><a name="index-ncp_002c-option-521"></a><a name="index-noChessProgram_002c-option-522"></a>If this option is true, XBoard acts as a passive chessboard; it
does not start a chess engine at all. Turning on this option
also turns off clockMode. Default: false. 
<br><dt>-mode or -initialMode modename<dd><a name="index-mode_002c-option-523"></a><a name="index-initalMode_002c-option-524"></a>If this option is given, XBoard selects the given modename
from the Mode menu after starting and (if applicable) processing the
loadGameFile or loadPositionFile option. Default: "" (no selection). 
Other supported values are
MachineWhite, MachineBlack, TwoMachines, Analysis,
AnalyzeFile, EditGame, EditPosition, and Training. 
<br><dt>-variant varname<dd><a name="index-variant_002c-option-525"></a>Activates preliminary, partial support for playing chess variants
against a local engine or editing variant games.  This flag is not
needed in ICS mode.  Recognized variant names are:

          unknown       Catchall for other unknown variants
</pre>
     <p>NOT ALL BOARDSIZES PROVIDE A COMPLETE SET OF BUILT-IN BITMAPS FOR ALL
UN-ORTHODOX PIECES, though. Only in <code>boardSize</code> middling and bulky
all 22 piece types are provided, while -boardSize petite has most
of them. Archbishop, Chancellor and Amazon are supported in every
size from petite to bulky. Kings or Amazons are substituted for
missing bitmaps. You can still play variants needing un-orthodox
pieces in other board sizes providing your own bitmaps through the
<code>bitmapDirectory</code> or <code>pixmapDirectory</code> options.

     <p>In the shuffle variants, XBoard now does shuffle the pieces, although
you can still do it by hand using Edit Position.  Some variants are
supported only in ICS mode, including bughouse, and
kriegspiel.  The winning/drawing conditions in crazyhouse (off-board
interposition on mate) are not fully understood, but losers, suicide,
giveaway, atomic, and 3check should be OK. 
Berolina and cylinder chess can only be played with legality testing off. 
In crazyhouse, XBoard now does keep
track of off-board pieces.  In shatranj it does implement the baring
rule when mate detection is switched on. 
<br><dt>-boardHeight N<dd><a name="index-boardHeight_002c-option-526"></a>Allows you to set a non-standard number of board ranks in any variant. 
If the height is given as -1, the default height for the variant is used. 
Default: -1
<br><dt>-boardWidth N<dd><a name="index-boardWidth_002c-option-527"></a>Allows you to set a non-standard number of board files in any variant. 
If the width is given as -1, the default width for the variant is used. 
With a non-standard width, the initial position will always be an empty board,
as the usual opening array will not fit. 
Default: -1
<br><dt>-holdingsSize N<dd><a name="index-holdingsSize_002c-option-528"></a>Allows you to set a non-standard size for the holdings in any variant. 
If the size is given as -1, the default holdings size for the variant is used. 
The first N piece types will go into the holdings on capture, and you will be
able to drop them on the board in stead of making a normal move. If size equals 0,
there will be no holdings. 
Default: -1
<br><dt>-defaultFrcPosition N<dd><a name="index-defaultFrcPosition_002c-option-529"></a>Specifies the number of the opening position in shuffle games like Chess960. 
A value of -1 means the position is randomly generated by XBoard
at the beginning of every game. 
Default: -1
<br><dt>-pieceToCharTable string<dd><a name="index-pieceToCharTable_002c-option-530"></a>The characters that are used to represent the piece types XBoard knows in FEN
diagrams and SAN moves. The string argument has to have an even length
(or it will be ignored), as white and black pieces have to be given separately
(in that order). The last letter for each color will be the King. 
The letters before that will be PNBRQ and then a whole host of fairy pieces
in an order that has not fully crystallized yet (currently FEACWMOHIJGDVSLU,
F=Ferz, Elephant, A=Archbishop, C=Chancellor, W=Wazir, M=Commoner, O=Cannon,
H=Nightrider). You should list at least all pieces that occur in the variant
you are playing. If you have less than 44 characters in the string, the pieces
not mentioned will get assigned a period, and you will not be able to distinguish
them in FENs. You can also explicitly assign pieces a period, in which case they
will not be counted in deciding which captured pieces can go into the holdings. 
A tilde '~' as a piece name does mean this piece is used to represent a promoted
Pawn in crazyhouse-like games, i.e. on capture it turns back onto a Pawn. 
A '+' similarly indicates the piece is a shogi-style promoted piece, that should
revert to its non-promoted version on capture (rather than to a Pawn). 
Note that promoted pieces are represented by pieces 11 further in the list. 
You should not have to use this option often: each variant has its own default
setting for the piece representation in FEN, which should be sufficient in normal use. 
Default: ""
<br><dt>-pieceNickNames string<dd><a name="index-pieceNickNames_002c-option-531"></a>The characters in the string are interpreted the same way as in the
<code>pieceToCharTable</code> option. But on input, piece-ID letters are
first looked up in the nicknames, and only if not defined there,
in the normal pieceToCharTable. This allows you to have two letters
designate the same piece, (e.g. N as an alternative to H for Horse
in Xiangqi), to make reading of non-compliant notations easier. 
Default: ""
<br><dt>-colorNickNames string<dd><a name="index-colorNickNames_002c-option-532"></a>The side-to-move field in a FEN will be first matched against the letters
in the string (first character for white, second for black),
before it is matched to the regular 'w' and 'b'. 
This makes it easier to read non-compliant FENs,
which, say, use 'r' for white. 
Default: ""
<br><dt>-debug/-xdebug or -debugMode true/false<dd><a name="index-debug_002c-option-533"></a><a name="index-debugMode_002c-option-534"></a>Turns on debugging printout. 
<br><dt>-debugFile filename or -nameOfDebugFile filename<dd><a name="index-debugFile_002c-option-535"></a><a name="index-nameOfDebugFile_002c-option-536"></a>Sets the name of the file to which XBoard saves debug information
(including all communication to and from the engines). 
A <kbd>%d</kbd> in the given file name (e.g. game%d.debug) will be replaced
by the unique sequence number of a tournament game,
so that the debug output of each game will be written on a separate file. 
<br><dt>-engineDebugOutput number<dd><a name="index-engineDebugOutput_002c-option-537"></a>Specifies how XBoard should handle unsolicited output from the engine,
with respect to saving it in the debug file. 
The output is further (hopefully) ignored. 
If number=0, XBoard refrains from writing such spurious output to the debug file. 
If number=1, all engine output is written faithfully to the debug file. 
If number=2, any protocol-violating line is prefixed with a '#' character,
as the engine itself should have done if it wanted to submit info for inclusion in the debug file. 
This option is provided for the benefit of applications that use the debug file
as a source of information, such as the broadcaster of live games TLCV / TLCS. 
Such applications can be protected from spurious engine output that might otherwise confuse them. 
<br><dt>-rsh or -remoteShell shell-name<dd><a name="index-rsh_002c-option-538"></a><a name="index-remoteShell_002c-option-539"></a>Name of the command used to run programs remotely. The default
is <samp><span class="file">rsh</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">remsh</span></samp>, determined when XBoard is
configured and compiled. 
<br><dt>-ruser or -remoteUser user-name<dd><a name="index-ruser_002c-option-540"></a><a name="index-remoteUser_002c-option-541"></a>User name on the remote system when running programs with the
<code>remoteShell</code>. The default is your local user name. 
<br><dt>-userName username<dd><a name="index-userName_002c-option-542"></a>Name under which the Human player will be listed in the PGN file. 
Default is the login name on your local computer. 
<br><dt>-delayBeforeQuit number<dt>-delayAfterQuit number<dd><a name="index-delayBeforeQuit_002c-option-543"></a><a name="index-delayAfterQuit_002c-option-544"></a>These options specify how long XBoard has to wait before sending a termination signal to rogue engine processes, that do not want to react to the 'quit' command. The second one determines the pause after killing the engine, to make sure it dies. 
<br><dt>-searchMode n<dd><a name="index-searchMode_002c-option-545"></a>The integer n encodes the mode for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">find position</span></samp>&rsquo; function. 
Default: 1 (= Exact position match)
<br><dt>-eloThresholdBoth elo<dt>-eloThresholdAny elo<dd><a name="index-eloThresholdBoth_002c-option-546"></a><a name="index-eloThresholdAny_002c-option-547"></a>Defines a lower limit for the Elo rating, which has to be surpassed
before a game will be considered when searching for a board position. 
Default: 0
<br><dt>-dateThreshold year<dd><a name="index-dateThreshold_002c-option-548"></a>Only games not played before the given year will be considered when
searching for a board position
