To help in making the polyglot.ini files for UCI engines,
you need to know what options the engine implements.
Polyglot GUI by Alex Guerrero is a program to assist in this.
It interrogates a selected engine for its options,
and then displays the options to the user as a menu dialog.
The user can then enter or alter the values for these options easily,
where needed,
(they all start as default value given by the engine).
After having done this,
the name of a .ini file can be entered, and the result saved on it.

<h3>Downloading and Installing Polyglot GUI</h3>
<p>
The direct download link for Plyglot GUI is given below.
Clicking it will invoke the browser download popup.
Click "Open" to open the zip file,
and you will see the two files it contains.
If this does not work, or if there is no button "Open" at all,
your download software does most likely not undestand the .rar format
in which Polyglot GUI is compressed.
In that case, you will have to click "Save" in stead,
and choose a temporary place to put the PolyglotGUI.zip file.
Before being able to proceed, you must then first obtain an unzip program that does
support rar format.
I always use 7Zip for this, and can recommend it.
In that case, read the following section.
If your browser could open the zip file, you can skip that section.
</p>
<h3>Downloading 7-Zip</h3>
<p>
The download link for 7-zip is given below, or click
<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">here</a>.
A number of different packaes can be downloaded, easiest is to click the .exe version for Windows.
This will probably trigger all kind of security alerts, so you have to convince your computer
somehow that you really want to do this a number of times.
It installs through a setup program, which you can invoke automatically by clicking the "Open" button.

</p>
<h3>Unpacking Polyglot GUI</h3>
<p>
Click "Extract al files" on the upper left,
and this will invoke the unpack wizard.
When it asks where to unpack the files,
(after clicking "Next" a few times),
click "browse", and browse to the Polyglot folder of the WinBoard Gold Pack
(~\Polyglot15w),
where the polyglot.ini files are.
When you finally click "Finish", the two unpacked files are stored there.
Polyglot GUI is the mmediately ready for use.
