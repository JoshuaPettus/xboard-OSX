<p>XBoard is a graphical user interface for chess in all its major
forms, including international chess, xiangqi (Chinese chess),
shogi (Japanese chess) and Makruk, in addition to many minor variants such as
Losers Chess, Crazyhouse, Chess960 and Capabanca Chess. It displays a
chessboard on the screen, accepts moves made with the mouse, and loads
and saves games in Portable Game Notation (PGN). It serves as a
front-end for many different chess services, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Chess engines that will run on your machine and play a game against
you or help you analyze, such as GNU Chess, Crafty, or many
others.</li>

<li>Chess servers on the Internet, where you can connect to play chess
with people from all over the world, watch other users play, or just
hang out and chat.</li>

<li>Correspondence chess played by electronic mail. The CMail program
automates the tasks of parsing email from your opponent, playing his
moves out on your board, and mailing your reply move after you've
chosen it.</li>
</ul>
<p>XBoard runs on Unix and Unix-like systems that use the X Window
System. </p>

<h3>Winboard</h3>

<p>The project also includes a port to 32-bit Windows systems called
WinBoard.</p>

<p>You can find the download section for Winboard at
the <a href="http://www.open-aurec.com/wbforum/viewforum.php?f=19">Winboard
Forum</a>.</p>

<p>Development for Winboard, reporting bugs and any other requests can
also be done at the same places as for XBoard (see below).</p>

<h3>Testers needed</h3>
<p> Our next versions will have some major improvements and we are always looking for people who are willing to test those and give us feedback or new ideas. If you are interested, please send an email to our list at <a href="mailto:xboard-devel@gnu.org">&lt;xboard-devel@gnu.org&gt;</a>.</p>

<h3>GTK developer needed</h3>
<p> We are also working on merging Winboard and XBoard back into one version using a cross platform GTK-front end. This will help us clean up the code and make things like internationalization easier. Progress is slow though, so if you know want to help out there are lots of things waiting to be done. Email the <a href="mailto:xboard-devel@gnu.org">mailing list</a> for more information. </p>

<h3>Downloading XBoard</h3>

<h4>stable version</h4>

<p>The current stable version
is: <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/xboard/">4.4.4</a></p>

<p>It can be found on the main GNU ftp server:
<a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/xboard/">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/xboard/</a> (via http) and
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/xboard/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/xboard/</a> (via ftp).</p>

<p>It can also be found on one of the <a href="/prep/ftp.html">mirrors
of ftp.gnu.org</a>;
please <a href="http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/xboard">use a mirror</a> if
possible.</p>

<p>Precompiled versions are available
for <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:/Factory:/Contrib/">openSUSE</a>
and <a href="http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/xboard">debian-squeeze</a>
(if you know of other distribution that package it, please let us
know).</p>

<h4>development version</h4>

<p>It would be great if people would like to help in the developing process. We can use all kinds of help, from people who just use the software and have a feature request (send them to developer mailing list), to people who can update/check the documentation and especially people who test development versions (send problems to the developer mailing list). </p>

<p>At the moment we have three developer versions:</p>

<ul>
<li>A snapshot of the 4.4.5 branch: 
Nothing here at the moment (just released 4.4.4).
<!-- This will become the next stable version.  <a href="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/xboard/">4.4.4.20100806</a>. 
A precompiled version will available soon for <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/apersaud/">openSUSE</a>. -->
    
</li>
<li>A snapshot of the master branch: <a href="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/xboard/">master-20101120</a>. <br />
   The master branch at this moment also includes changes that will go in future version, but not necessary in the next release. Since this includes lots of changes, chances for major bugs are higher. A precompiled packaged version is available for <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/apersaud/">openSUSE </a> and <a href="http://packages.debian.org/experimental/xboard">debian</a>.

</li>
<li>A snapshot of the gtk branch: <a href="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/xboard/">gtk-20100806</a>. <br />
   In the gtk branch we are working on merging Winboard and Xboard back together using a gtk-frontend. This code doesn't work 100% yet, it will crash quite often, but you can almost play normal games against a machine already. A precompiled version is available for <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/apersaud/">openSUSE</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h5>How to build the development version</h5>

<h6>git version</h6>
<p> After cloning the git-repository, do ./autogen.sh, ./configure and then a make.</p>

<h6>tar-balls</h6>
<p> Unpack the tar ball and do ./configure followed by make.</p>


<p>For development sources and other information, please see
the <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/xboard/">XBoard project
page</a> at <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org">savannah.gnu.org</a>.</p>

<p>A snapshot of the latest source code for all branches is available at
the <a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/xboard.git">git
repository</a> on Savannah.</p>

<h4>archive</h4>

<p>You can also find an archive of old versions on <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/xboard/">the ftp server</a>.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p><a href="manual/">Documentation for XBoard</a> is available online,
as is <a href="/manual/">documentation for most GNU software</a>.  You
may also find more information about XBoard by
running <em>info&nbsp;xboard</em> or <em>man&nbsp;xboard</em>, or by
looking at <em>/usr/doc/xboard/</em>,
<em>/usr/local/doc/xboard/</em>, or similar directories on your system.</p>
