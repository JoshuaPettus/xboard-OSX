<h2>What is new in WinBoard / XBoard 4.5.3?</h2>

<table cellpadding="10"><tr><td>
<img src="Paging.png">
</td><td valign="top">
 <p> This version fixes some bugs found in 4.5.2. Below is a quick list of the changes.
Note that the paging of the XBoard Game List (illustrated by the screenshot on the left)
is a change that is really a bit more involved than what we would like to do in a stable version. 
But the bug was so severe that we decided to chance it.
